# 🚨 SIMPLE FIX - Guaranteed to Work

## The Problem
Complex expand/collapse logic doesn't work reliably on mobile.

## The Solution
**Always show all section scores** - no expand/collapse at all.

## Changes Needed

### Option A: Always Expanded (No Toggle)
- Remove expand button
- Show all section scores by default
- Card height is taller but no interaction needed

### Option B: Accordion with CSS Only
- Use `<details>` and `<summary>` HTML elements
- Native browser accordion
- No JavaScript needed
- Works 100% on all devices

### Option C: Separate Mobile View
- Desktop: Expandable cards
- Mobile: All cards always expanded OR list view

## Which Do You Want?

Tell me:
- **"Option A"** - Always show scores (simple, works everywhere)
- **"Option B"** - CSS-only accordion (native, reliable)
- **"Option C"** - Different mobile layout

I'll implement whichever you choose in 5 minutes.

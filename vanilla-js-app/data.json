While account ownership and context were evident, the discussion did not sufficiently highlight what was prioritized, why it mattered, or what tangibly changed for the client as a result. Going forward, this section should focus on 2–3 clearly defined initiatives delivered in 2025 and frame them around results and impact rather than general account context.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Value creation beyond the core contract was not clearly demonstrated. The review lacked concrete examples of value-added services or cost avoidance efforts delivered in 2025, and there was limited translation of actions into operational, financial, or risk-based impact. To strengthen this area, future reviews should clearly call out specific decisions or actions that delivered incremental value and explain why those decisions mattered to the client.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost savings delivered in 2025 were not clearly articulated. The review did not identify ownership of cost reduction initiatives, workflow improvements, or efficiency gains. At the Account Director level, it is important to explicitly call out savings achieved, how they were created, and whether they are repeatable or one-time in nature.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "The review did not clearly demonstrate leadership in innovation or continuous improvement. While collaboration and alignment were referenced, there was limited evidence of new processes, tools, or enhancements implemented in 2025 or the results of those efforts. This section should highlight where you led change, tested new approaches, or improved how the account operates, along with the outcomes and learnings.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Challenges and gaps from 2025 were not meaningfully addressed. The review would be stronger with greater transparency around what did not go as planned, what could have been done differently, and what corrective actions were taken or are planned. Clear ownership and reflection are expected at this level.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "A clear, actionable 2026 account strategy was not fully articulated. While general intent was present, the review lacked a cohesive roadmap outlining priorities, sequencing, and how the account will be elevated through retention, growth, or differentiation. Future reviews should present a structured forward plan tied to specific initiatives and outcomes.",

However, the discussion would benefit from a more structured, outcome-driven narrative. Executive presence is strongest when the story is concise, results-focused, and clearly connects performance, challenges, and forward strategy."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Given Brian’s mid-year start, the review demonstrated a reasonable grasp of the portfolio and an understanding of the major initiatives in motion. Oversight across multiple relationships was clear, and there was evidence of active engagement and learning. That said, the articulation of initiatives leaned more toward inherited context and shared ownership than clearly defined initiatives Brian personally drove in 2025. As Brian moves into a full-year role, I would expect clearer framing around what he owns end-to-end, why those initiatives matter, and what changed for the client as a result.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Brian showed awareness of where value is created across the portfolio and how different teams contribute. However, value-adds and cost avoidance efforts were not yet clearly framed as deliberate actions owned by Brian with defined impact. This is understandable given tenure, but going forward, I would expect more explicit examples of decisions or interventions that delivered incremental value beyond the contract, even if directional in nature.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost savings delivered in 2025 were not clearly articulated. Given the timing of Brian’s start, this is not unexpected, but this section lacked clarity around ownership of savings, execution, or sustainability. As Brian enters a full operating year, it will be important to explicitly call out cost savings achieved, how they were driven, and whether they are repeatable improvements tied to financial stewardship.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Brian demonstrated openness to learning the portfolio and engaging with existing processes and teams. However, leadership in driving new processes, tools, or meaningful improvements was not yet clearly established. This is appropriate for a ramp period. In 2026, I would expect Brian to move from participation to leadership by identifying opportunities to improve how the portfolio operates and testing changes with measurable outcomes.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Brian was transparent about his tenure, the inherited nature of many challenges, and the shared accountability across the team. There was a healthy tone of ownership without defensiveness, which is important at this level. To continue building strength here, future reviews should include clearer reflection on what Brian would approach differently and specific corrective actions he intends to drive, with timelines.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "A general forward-looking intent was present, but the 2026 strategy was not yet articulated as a clear, cohesive roadmap. This is reasonable given time in role. As Brian moves into a full planning cycle, I would expect a more structured strategy outlining priorities, sequencing, and how the portfolio will be elevated through retention, growth, and differentiation",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Brian demonstrated self-awareness around his ramp and role scope, which is a positive signal. Personal development goals, however, were not yet clearly defined or measurable. As he matures in the role, I would expect clearer leadership goals tied directly to portfolio performance, team development, and operational outcomes.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Brian communicated professionally and engaged appropriately with senior leaders. Executive presence is developing, and confidence will naturally increase with tenure. Going forward, tightening the narrative around outcomes, ownership, and forward strategy will strengthen Brian’s ability to lead executive-level account discussions more decisively.\r\n\r\nBrian is in a reasonable ramp phase and is demonstrating the right fundamentals: openness, accountability, and engagement across a complex portfolio. The primary opportunity moving into 2026 is shifting from shared context to clear ownership, tightening outcome-based storytelling, and more explicitly articulating impact. With a full year in role, expectations will appropriately rise, and Brian is positioned to meet them with stronger clarity and execution discipline."

He demonstrated strong judgment in identifying what is working, where a repeatable playbook exists, and how success on his accounts can be leveraged more broadly. While the initiatives were clearly described, client impact was often implied rather than explicitly stated. This section would be further strengthened by more direct articulation of what changed for the client as a result of these initiatives and, where possible, anchoring outcomes with measurable results.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Mark provided strong examples of value creation beyond core contract scope, especially through innovation, sustainability-focused thinking, and differentiated use of existing tools such as 4insite. His commentary reflected intentional decision-making and a clear understanding of how value can be created without deviating from core SVM systems. To elevate to the highest level, Mark could further translate these value-add efforts into clearer financial, operational, or risk-based impact to reinforce the tangible benefit delivered to the client.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Mark referenced efficiency improvements and operational refinements that suggest cost discipline and improved service delivery. However, cost savings were not clearly quantified or distinguished as repeatable versus one-time improvements. This section would benefit from clearer ownership of execution and more explicit articulation of how savings were created, sustained, and leveraged over time. Even directional estimates or examples would strengthen the demonstration of financial stewardship.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Mark demonstrated exceptional leadership in innovation and continuous improvement. His approach to leveraging existing platforms differently, building scalable playbooks, and challenging traditional execution models showed intentional experimentation, learning, and iteration. The level of interest generated from senior leadership and peers reinforces the impact and credibility of this work. Mark clearly operates with an enterprise mindset and has created innovation that is transferable beyond his immediate accounts.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Mark was transparent and self-aware in discussing the challenges of scale, particularly the need to transition from being deeply involved in innovation execution to leading through direction, playbooks, and governance. He demonstrated ownership of this gap and articulated a thoughtful reflection on what needs to change to support continued growth. To reach a 5, this section could include more explicit corrective actions with timelines tied to how Mark plans to operationalize this shift in 2026.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Mark articulated a strong forward-looking strategy centered on scalability, sustainability, and elevating successful account practices into repeatable models. The vision was cohesive and clearly connected to improving execution at scale. This section would be further strengthened by more explicit sequencing, timelines, and linkage to retention, growth, and differentiation outcomes for 2026.",

These goals demonstrate strong role maturity, self-awareness, and readiness for increased scope. The alignment between personal development and organizational needs was particularly strong.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Mark communicated with confidence and credibility, demonstrating strong command of his material and an ability to engage executive audiences. His presentation sparked interest, follow-up requests, and broader organizational dialogue, which reflects effective executive presence. To elevate further, tightening structure and explicitly anchoring innovation discussions to outcomes and metrics would enhance clarity and executive-level impact."

His work around renewal strategy, reinvestment planning, wage structure alignment, and proactive pricing architecture demonstrated strong judgment and long-term thinking. These initiatives were intentionally executed well ahead of renewal timelines and materially reduced risk while strengthening the partnership. The linkage between initiative, outcome, and client impact was clear, particularly in how these actions positioned SBM as a trusted, forward-thinking partner rather than a reactive vendor.",

Rather than defaulting to cost reduction, he aligned reinvestment strategies with NVIDIA’s growth objectives and CBRE’s expectations, reinforcing trust and long-term retention. The ability to ask the right questions, confirm client intent, and then deliberately reinvest margin back into the account reflects strong commercial judgment and credibility. This is a textbook example of value creation rooted in partnership, not short-term optimization.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "While cost savings were not the primary driver for this account, Stuart clearly demonstrated financial stewardship through disciplined margin management, proactive wage forecasting, and mitigation of renewal and RFP risk. The account’s strong financial performance at scale is not accidental and reflects sustained execution. This section could be elevated further by explicitly framing how financial performance was protected over time and which practices are repeatable across other large enterprise accounts.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Stuart showed strong leadership in continuously improving how the account is structured and managed, particularly through consolidated pricing models, early implementation of renewal strategies, and thoughtful reinvestment decisions. These improvements were practical, intentional, and outcome-oriented. To reach a 5, the next step would be documenting and formalizing these approaches into a repeatable playbook that can be leveraged across similar strategic accounts.",

He showed ownership without defensiveness and made deliberate, data-backed choices aligned to client priorities. This section would be further strengthened by explicitly calling out any moments of trade-off or course correction and what was learned as a result.",

The sequencing, foresight, and alignment across NVIDIA and CBRE position this account for continued success and differentiation.",

He presented a structured, compelling narrative and responded effectively to executive feedback and questions. His ability to communicate complex financial and strategic decisions in a clear, credible way reflects strong executive presence.\r\n\r\nStuart is operating at a very high level and sets a strong benchmark for strategic account leadership. The NVIDIA account is a top performer not just financially, but relationally, and that outcome reflects deliberate choices, strong judgment, and disciplined execution. The opportunity ahead is scaling this approach, codifying it, and using it as a reference model for other large enterprise accounts across the portfolio."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Grant demonstrated strong ownership of the account and articulated several well-considered focus areas, including revenue growth, operational stability, leadership development, and cross-campus collaboration. The strategic thinking and prioritization were clear. However, the discussion focused more on execution approach and future intent than on clearly framed 2025 initiatives delivered and their direct impact on the client. To strengthen this section, Grant should more explicitly separate what was delivered in 2025 from forward-looking plans and clearly articulate what changed for the client as a result, supported by measurable outcomes where possible.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Grant showed thoughtful intent around creating value beyond the contract, particularly through efficiency gains and more deliberate use of ATB versus goodwill work. The underlying judgment and approach are strong. To improve, Grant should highlight concrete examples of value delivered in 2025 and translate those efforts into financial, operational, or risk-based impact, even at a directional level. Doing so would better demonstrate the tangible value created for the client.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Grant acknowledged the importance of efficiency and margin improvement and discussed opportunities to drive savings through workflow optimization and smarter execution. However, the review did not clearly articulate cost savings delivered in 2025, nor did it quantify or distinguish between one-time versus repeatable savings. This section would be strengthened by explicitly calling out savings achieved, describing how they were executed, and clarifying ownership and sustainability to demonstrate stronger financial stewardship.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Grant demonstrated strong leadership in innovation and continuous improvement, particularly through forward-thinking exploration of AI-enabled decision support and data-driven contract and ATB optimization. The willingness to test, learn, and potentially scale new tools reflects a proactive and enterprise-minded approach. To reach the highest level, this section would benefit from clearer linkage to pilots, experiments, or early outcomes in 2025, along with lessons learned that inform next steps.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Grant showed transparency in acknowledging the importance of maintaining operational stability while pursuing growth and recognized the inherent challenges that come with scaling. There was a clear sense of ownership and awareness of risk. To further strengthen this section, Grant could deepen reflection by explicitly calling out specific challenges faced in 2025, what could have been done differently, and outlining corrective actions or guardrails with clearer timelines.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Grant articulated a clear, compelling, and well-prioritized 2026 forward strategy focused on revenue growth, leadership development, cross-campus collaboration, and enterprise capability expansion. The strategy was proactive, cohesive, and strongly connected to retention, growth, and differentiation. The vision demonstrated strong judgment, sequencing, and scalability, with clear intent to elevate both the account and broader organizational capabilities.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Grant clearly defined thoughtful, leadership-level professional goals that align strongly with Account Director expectations and demonstrate role maturity. The goals were forward-looking, measurable in intent, and focused on developing leaders, improving margins, and driving enterprise-level impact. Grant demonstrated a strong growth mindset and readiness to operate at increased scope and influence.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Grant communicated confidently and demonstrated strong command of the material, clearly articulating priorities and responding effectively to executive feedback. The discussion had logical flow and depth, and executive presence was evident throughout. To elevate further, Grant could tighten pacing and sharpen storytelling around outcomes and impact to ensure maximum clarity and resonance with senior executive audiences."

Additionally, I would have appreciated more insight into client feedback beyond the general statement that ‘the client is excited,’ to better understand their perspective and thoughts on the programs.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "This portion of the presentation felt broadly outlined and lacked the specifics needed to provide deeper insight into the challenges and opportunities. The statement, ‘We need to figure out a way to drive innovation and the speed of innovation,’ without identifying the roadblocks or challenges, leaves much open to interpretation. Have we sought support to address these issues? As leaders and partners, managing accounts holistically is part of our role. A clearer understanding of why this is a challenge would be valuable. Are communication gaps with our partners contributing to this? Were we waiting for them to initiate? There seemed to be a lot left unsaid.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "I appreciated the emphasis on aligning with our partner around a shared vision. However, what does that vision entail? What does true alignment look like? Forward looking innovation was mentioned, but the specifics were unclear. What exactly are we innovating? The passion to support our partner and elevate value to Google came through strongly, which is greatly appreciated. What was missing were the concrete details: what steps we will take, how we will execute them, and the timeline for delivery.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "The goals presented are commendable and will undoubtedly add value to our programs, team members, and partners. However, how will these goals be measured, and how is success defined? They felt more team and program oriented than personal, which is valuable, but I would also love to understand Paul’s personal goals.  What does he hope to achieve and what is the impact he envisions?",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Considering Paul’s relatively short tenure and limited time on the account, he did a fantastic job. However, references to his brief time, such as explicitly stating it upfront, seemed to be his desire lower expectations for the presentation. Removing those mentions would have strengthened the delivery and conveyed greater confidence. With more time on the account, I believe many of the gaps noted in the presentation will naturally be addressed, given the strength of his talking points and overall presentation. Gaining full account awareness will be a key advantage for him moving forward."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Paul articulated several meaningful initiatives underway across the Google portfolio, including the shift toward a more intentional, unified account strategy, demand-based cleaning pilots, enhanced cleaning programs, and scope expansion through competitor displacement. The initiatives themselves were relevant and well selected. However, the framing leaned more toward describing what was happening or what partners were asking for rather than clearly articulating the outcomes those initiatives were designed to achieve. To strengthen this section, Paul should more explicitly define the objective behind each initiative, what success looks like for the client, and what changed or will change as a result.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Paul demonstrated awareness of how value can be created through improved alignment, reduced noise, and more predictable outcomes for the client. There were clear signals of partnership and responsiveness to JLL and Google priorities. That said, value adds and cost avoidance were largely described at a conceptual level. Going forward, this section would benefit from clearer examples of deliberate decisions or actions taken that delivered incremental value beyond the contract, and from translating those efforts into operational, financial, or risk-reduction impact.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "While efficiency and demand-based models were discussed, cost savings delivered in 2025 were not clearly articulated or quantified. There was limited clarity on ownership of savings, execution details, or whether improvements are repeatable versus pilot-based. Given Paul’s tenure, this is understandable, but as he moves into a full operating year, I would expect clearer articulation of cost savings achieved, how they were driven, and how they will be sustained without eroding service quality or partnership trust.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Paul demonstrated a willingness to challenge the status quo and explore new operating models, particularly through right-time cleaning, enhanced cleaning programs, and pilot approaches at Westlake. These efforts reflect the right mindset. To elevate this further, future reviews should more clearly differentiate between ideas being tested versus innovations already delivering results, and capture lessons learned that inform broader rollout or course correction.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Paul acknowledged real challenges across the Google portfolio, including operational noise, siloed execution, and partner-driven change requests. There was openness around tension points, particularly where efficiency initiatives could impact flexibility or responsiveness. To strengthen this section, Paul should more explicitly state what he would do differently, where trade-offs were made, and what corrective actions or guardrails he plans to put in place with clear timelines.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Paul articulated a general forward-looking direction focused on unifying the account view, improving predictability, and scaling successful initiatives across regions. The intent is sound, but the strategy would benefit from sharper definition. Moving forward, I would expect a clearer 2026 roadmap that outlines priorities, sequencing, and how these initiatives directly support retention, growth, and differentiation for Google.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Paul demonstrated appropriate self-awareness given his short time in role and showed a thoughtful approach to learning the portfolio and relationships. Personal development goals, however, were not yet clearly articulated or measurable. As Paul settles into the role, I would expect clearer leadership goals tied to account outcomes, team alignment, and execution discipline.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Paul communicated clearly and professionally and demonstrated comfort engaging with senior stakeholders. Executive presence is developing, and confidence will naturally increase with tenure. To elevate further, tightening the narrative around outcomes, ownership, and decision rationale will help Paul lead executive-level discussions with greater authority and clarity.\r\n\r\nPaul is in a reasonable ramp phase and is demonstrating the right instincts around strategy, partnership, and modernization of the Google account. The primary opportunity moving into 2026 is sharpening outcome-based framing, clearly defining ownership versus partner-driven initiatives, and translating strategy into measurable results. With greater clarity on the “why” behind initiatives and more explicit articulation of impact, Paul is well positioned to strengthen his effectiveness and influence over the next year."

The reallocation of budget to add leadership support without additional cost to the client is a clear and credible value add, with meaningful financial impact. Given the limitations of the environment, this was a strong example of working creatively within constraints. This section could be further strengthened by framing additional value in terms of risk mitigation, continuity of service, or avoided operational disruption.",

She also demonstrated strong awareness of the account’s profitability and financial structure.

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Ana clearly articulated the most important initiatives delivered in 2025, particularly around the LinkedIn transition, early stabilization, safety improvements, and rapid operational adjustments at HQ. She demonstrated strong ownership in navigating a complex transition without an IFM partner and establishing direct client relationships early. To elevate this to a 5, the narrative could be tightened by prioritizing the top initiatives and more explicitly framing what changed for the client in measurable terms as a result of each effort.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Ana demonstrated strong value creation beyond the base contract, especially through the tiered cost optimization proposals and proactive repositioning as a strategic partner rather than a reactive vendor. Delivering clear productivity scenarios and potential savings ranges was a solid example of intentional value-add. This section would be further strengthened by translating proposed savings into realized outcomes or clearly distinguishing between delivered versus potential value.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Ana articulated potential cost savings opportunities well, particularly through productivity tiering and staffing model adjustments. However, most savings discussed were directional or proposed rather than clearly executed and sustained in 2025. As the account matures, I would expect clearer articulation of savings that were actually delivered, how they were achieved, and whether they are repeatable going forward.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Ana demonstrated a strong continuous improvement mindset, particularly through rapid schedule redesign, hybrid staffing models, and operational refinements that reduced service tickets and improved client experience. These improvements were practical, responsive, and impactful. To reach a 5, the next step would be formalizing these approaches into repeatable practices that can be scaled across similar accounts.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Ana was transparent and accountable in discussing challenges, including the Omaha exit, staffing misalignment, and lingering client perceptions from prior account losses. She demonstrated strong self-awareness, owned the gaps, and clearly articulated what she would do differently moving forward. This level of reflection and accountability is a strong leadership signal.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Ana articulated a clear forward-looking approach centered on strengthening talent placement, repairing key stakeholder relationships, and continuing to position SBM as a proactive partner. The strategy is grounded and aligned with client priorities. This section could be strengthened further by sequencing initiatives and explicitly tying them to retention, growth, or expansion opportunities in 2026.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Ana demonstrated strong role maturity and growth readiness, particularly in her willingness to self-reflect, make leadership changes, and adjust approach quickly when things were not working. Continued focus on scaling her decision-making and enabling consistent execution across sites will further increase her impact.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Ana communicated clearly and confidently, with strong command of operational details and client context. She led the discussion effectively and responded well to questions. Tightening prioritization and sharpening the storyline around outcomes and impact would further strengthen executive-level storytelling.\r\n\r\nAna delivered a strong, well-rounded review that demonstrated ownership, resilience, and a clear ability to stabilize and improve complex accounts. Her transparency around challenges and willingness to course-correct are real strengths. The opportunity ahead is sharpening outcome-based framing and clearly distinguishing delivered impact from proposed initiatives to consistently operate at a 5 level."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Taylor clearly articulated several material 2025 initiatives tied directly to Microsoft’s evolving needs, including campus expansion, return-to-office reoccupancy, and sustainability pilots. The scope, scale, and outcomes were well defined, particularly where initiatives translated into incremental square footage, FTE growth, and meaningful revenue impact. To reach a 5, future reviews should more explicitly separate initiatives delivered versus in-flight and tighten the narrative around what specifically changed for Microsoft as a result of each decision.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Taylor demonstrated strong value creation beyond base contract requirements, particularly through proactive support of Microsoft’s return-to-office strategy and sustainability initiatives. These efforts clearly positioned SBM as a strategic partner rather than a reactive vendor. While the value narrative was compelling, translating more of these efforts into clearer financial, operational, or risk-avoidance framing would further strengthen the impact.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost efficiency was discussed primarily through right-sizing, productivity alignment, and sustainability outcomes rather than direct cost savings. While this is appropriate given the growth-oriented nature of the account, this section would benefit from clearer articulation of where savings were achieved, avoided, or structurally embedded into the operating model. Even directional estimates or examples of sustained efficiencies would elevate this score.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Taylor showed strong leadership in innovation, most notably through the biodigester pilot and sustainability efforts. These initiatives demonstrated a willingness to test, learn, and iterate while aligning with Microsoft’s broader ESG priorities. Clear outcomes and lessons learned were shared. Continued focus on scaling these innovations across the portfolio or formalizing them into repeatable playbooks would move this to an exceptional rating.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Challenges were acknowledged, particularly around rapid scale, reoccupancy complexity, and execution pressure tied to Microsoft’s mandates. While ownership was evident, this section would benefit from deeper reflection on what was hardest, what could have been done differently, and what corrective actions are being put in place with timelines. More explicit self-assessment would strengthen accountability signaling.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Taylor articulated a clear forward-looking strategy focused on growth, retention, sustainability expansion, and positioning for future renewal. The linkage between 2025 initiatives and 2026 priorities was logical and credible. To reach a 5, future articulation should include clearer sequencing, defined milestones, and how SBM will continue to differentiate itself as Microsoft’s needs evolve.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Taylor demonstrated strong role maturity and readiness, particularly in managing large-scale growth, complex stakeholder environments, and innovation-driven initiatives. Personal goals were implied through ownership of major programs and forward planning. Making those goals more explicit and measurable would further reinforce leadership development and accountability.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Taylor communicated confidently at an executive level, handled complex topics well, and demonstrated command of both the account and the data. The narrative was logical and outcome-oriented, though occasionally dense. Sharpening concision and prioritization of the “so what” for executives would further elevate presence and impact.\r\n\r\nTaylor is operating at a high level on a complex, high-visibility account and is clearly trusted by the client to support growth, transformation, and innovation. His strongest strengths are scale management, commercial impact, and alignment to client strategy. The next step is tightening executive storytelling, sharpening accountability reflection, and translating innovation into repeatable enterprise value. Taylor is on a strong trajectory and is delivering at a level consistent with top-tier Account Director performance."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Jack highlighted several important wins in 2025, particularly contract renewals and account expansion driven by long-standing relationships with Nike and GXO. The strength and longevity of those relationships are real and clearly matter. That said, the review leaned heavily on relationship history rather than clearly articulated initiatives delivered in 2025. To strengthen this section, Jack should more explicitly frame what was intentionally done in 2025, why those actions mattered, and what changed for the client as a result beyond continued continuity.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Jack demonstrated a strong service mindset and clear intent to deliver value beyond the contract, particularly through deep cleanings during down days, preventive maintenance support, and discretionary work performed without incremental charges. These examples reflect trust, partnership, and good judgment. To elevate further, this section would benefit from clearer structure around how value-add decisions are made and more explicit translation of these efforts into operational or risk-based impact for the client.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Jack articulated meaningful cost savings and avoidance delivered in 2025, with reasonable estimates tied to deep cleanings, preventive maintenance, and efficiency improvements. The fact that the account has remained consistently green is a strong signal of financial stewardship. This section could be strengthened further by clearly distinguishing which savings are repeatable versus opportunistic and tying them more directly to sustainable operating practices.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Jack demonstrated practical continuous improvement through proactive use of downtime, efficient deployment of labor, and willingness to go beyond minimum scope. However, innovation was framed more as situational execution than intentional process change. To elevate this area, I would expect clearer examples of new processes, tools, or playbooks introduced in 2025 that can be replicated across other accounts.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Challenges and risks were not deeply explored in this review. While the account is performing well, a stronger executive-level review would include reflection on where friction exists, what trade-offs were made, or where future risk may emerge. Surfacing those areas proactively, even when performance is strong, is an important leadership signal.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "The review did not clearly articulate a forward-looking 2026 strategy beyond continued strong execution and partnership. Given the maturity and scale of the account, I would expect a more explicit roadmap outlining how the relationship will be further strengthened, expanded, or differentiated in 2026.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Jack clearly demonstrates role maturity through consistency, discipline, and relationship stewardship. Personal development goals, however, were not explicitly articulated. As expectations rise, clearer articulation of leadership goals and how Jack plans to evolve his impact would strengthen this section.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Jack communicated comfortably and confidently and clearly knows his accounts well. The presentation relied more on conversational explanation than a structured executive narrative. Tightening the storyline around initiatives, outcomes, and forward strategy would strengthen executive presence and ensure the full impact of the work is clearly conveyed.\r\n\r\nJack runs a very stable, high-performing account with exceptional client trust and consistent financial results. That foundation is strong and should not be understated. The opportunity ahead is elevating how that performance is framed and articulated at an executive level—moving from “we do a great job and the client trusts us” to clearly documenting initiatives, outcomes, risks, and forward strategy. With that shift, Jack’s reviews will better reflect the true strength of the account and his leadership."

He framed the year around portfolio-level performance, including quality, safety, and financial results. That said, the review leaned more toward aggregated performance and context than clearly defined initiatives that Isaac personally drove in 2025. To elevate this section, I would expect clearer articulation of 2–3 specific initiatives he owned end-to-end, why they mattered, and what changed for the client as a result.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Isaac showed awareness of where value is created across the portfolio and referenced financial and operational highlights at a high level. However, value adds and cost avoidance efforts were primarily discussed in aggregate rather than as intentional, decision-driven actions. To strengthen this section, future reviews should highlight concrete examples of value delivered beyond the contract and clearly translate those efforts into operational, financial, or risk-based impact.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost performance and financial discipline were referenced, particularly in the context of portfolio growth and integration of new business. However, cost savings were not clearly broken down in terms of ownership, execution, or sustainability. To raise this score, Isaac should explicitly call out savings achieved in 2025, explain how they were driven, and distinguish between one-time and repeatable improvements.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Isaac demonstrated a continuous improvement mindset by reviewing trends in KPIs, safety, and quality across the portfolio and using data to inform discussion. However, innovation was framed more as analysis and monitoring than as leadership of new processes, tools, or changes in how the business operates. To elevate this section, I would expect clearer examples of initiatives tested, improvements implemented, and lessons learned that can be scaled.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Isaac acknowledged the challenges associated with portfolio growth, new client onboarding, and variability in performance metrics. There was openness to discussing the data and its implications. This section would be stronger with more explicit reflection on what did not go as planned, what Isaac would approach differently, and what corrective actions were taken or are planned, with clearer ownership and timelines.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Isaac articulated general forward-looking intent around continued stabilization, performance improvement, and leveraging the expanded portfolio. The direction is sound, but the strategy would benefit from sharper definition.

Personal development goals, however, were not clearly articulated or measurable.

The presentation was conversational and collaborative, which helped encourage dialogue. To elevate executive presence further, tightening structure and leading more explicitly with outcomes, decisions, and impact would strengthen the overall account narrative.\r\n\r\nIsaac is managing a complex, multi-client portfolio and demonstrates solid fundamentals in analysis, engagement, and accountability. The primary opportunity moving forward is sharpening ownership and outcome-based storytelling—moving from aggregated performance to clearly articulated initiatives, decisions, and impact. With more explicit framing around what he drives personally and how it changes outcomes, Isaac can strengthen his positioning relative to peers and raise his overall effectiveness."

The overview demonstrated awareness of account dynamics and an understanding of where momentum and friction exist. That said, many of the initiatives were framed as inherited or collaborative efforts rather than clearly articulated initiatives Patrick personally drove. Going forward, I would expect clearer framing around what Patrick owned end-to-end, why those initiatives mattered, and what changed for the client as a result.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Patrick demonstrated an understanding of value creation through proactive engagement, particularly in navigating renewals, pricing discussions, and absorption planning following revenue reductions. However, value-add efforts were largely described as responses to external pressures rather than deliberate, proactive decisions that delivered incremental value. This section would be stronger with clearer examples of value delivered beyond contract scope and more explicit translation into financial, operational, or risk-based impact.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Patrick clearly articulated the financial impact of the McKesson renewal and showed ownership in working with site leadership to absorb revenue reductions while maintaining service levels. The discussion reflected financial awareness and discipline. To elevate this further, I would expect clearer articulation of cost savings actually delivered, how those savings were executed, and whether they are repeatable or one-time measures tied to long-term sustainability.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "While Patrick demonstrated effort in stabilizing challenged sites and working through transitions, innovation and continuous improvement were primarily framed around remediation rather than intentional process or model changes. This is understandable given the timing and complexity of the portfolio. Moving into 2026, I would expect clearer leadership in identifying improvements to staffing models, subcontractor strategy, or operating cadence that can be scaled beyond individual sites.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Patrick was transparent and detailed in outlining challenges across Cardinal Health, IQVIA, and McKesson, including subcontractor economics, CSAT issues, turnover, and partner transitions. He demonstrated ownership of these challenges without deflection and clearly articulated contributing factors. This is a strength. To elevate further, future reviews should include clearer corrective action plans with timelines and success criteria to show forward momentum, not just diagnosis.",

Tightening the storyline around priorities, decisions, and outcomes would strengthen executive presence and ensure the most important messages land clearly.\r\n\r\nPatrick stepped into a complex, mixed-performance portfolio mid-year and demonstrated transparency, effort, and accountability in addressing real challenges. His strongest signal is willingness to surface issues and engage directly with difficult realities. The opportunity ahead is shifting from reactive stabilization to proactive leadership—clearly defining owned initiatives, driving repeatable improvements, and sharpening outcome-based storytelling. With a full year ahead, expectations will rise, and Patrick has a clear path to strengthening his impact."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Aaron clearly articulated the operating model and outcomes for the 3M account, with a strong emphasis on stability, safety, and consistency. While there were no major transformational initiatives delivered in 2025, Aaron demonstrated sound judgment in prioritizing operational discipline and reliability given the size and scope of the account. To elevate this section, future reviews should more explicitly frame initiatives as deliberate leadership decisions, including why maintaining a “model site” was strategically important and how that approach could translate into broader client or portfolio impact.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Aaron effectively highlighted cost avoidance through recordable-free operations, low turnover, and a lean staffing model, all of which contribute to reduced risk and operational noise for the client. The value narrative is directionally strong, particularly around avoided incidents and stability. To strengthen this further, Aaron should more consistently quantify value adds and clearly distinguish between baseline performance and intentional value delivered beyond contract expectations.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Aaron demonstrated an understanding of indirect cost savings through incident avoidance, reduced overtime, and minimized retraining costs. While these savings were not formally tracked or deeply quantified, the rationale was credible and aligned to the operating model. This section would benefit from clearer articulation of how savings are measured, sustained, and repeatable, particularly if the 3M model is intended to be scaled to more complex accounts.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "The 3M account was intentionally managed with a “no surprises” mindset, which is appropriate given its scope and revenue profile. However, innovation and continuous improvement were largely framed as maintaining discipline rather than testing or implementing new processes. Looking ahead, Aaron has an opportunity to demonstrate leadership by extracting learnings from this model site and actively applying them to higher-complexity accounts or broader portfolio improvements.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Aaron was transparent in acknowledging the primary limitation of the 3M account: constrained growth and limited opportunity for value expansion. He demonstrated clear ownership of those realities without deflection and showed thoughtful reflection on what the account is and is not designed to deliver. This level of clarity and accountability is a strength and reflects sound leadership maturity.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Aaron articulated a clear and appropriate forward strategy for 2026, positioning 3M as a benchmark or model account rather than forcing artificial growth. His plan to leverage the account as a governance, safety, and operational playbook for more complex portfolios shows strong judgment. To reach a top score, future plans should include more explicit sequencing and examples of how insights from 3M will be operationalized elsewhere.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Aaron defined clear personal goals tied to account performance, including maintaining zero reportables, improving audit performance, and formally showcasing the account as a best-practice example. These goals demonstrate role maturity, accountability, and a growth mindset. Continued focus on expanding impact beyond individual sites will further strengthen leadership readiness.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Aaron led the discussion with clarity, confidence, and a structured narrative. He demonstrated strong command of the data and consistently tied operational details back to outcomes that matter to executive stakeholders. With continued refinement around concise storytelling and sharper framing of strategic decisions, Aaron’s executive presence will continue to strengthen."

The scope and complexity of these initiatives were evident, particularly in Mascoutah, Huntsville, Fort Walton Beach, and Swansea. Justin demonstrated strong ownership and execution. To reach a 5, future reviews should further tighten the narrative around why each initiative mattered most to Boeing and more explicitly connect each effort to measurable client outcomes.",

These efforts clearly reinforced SBM’s position as a proactive partner rather than a reactive vendor. To strengthen this section further, Justin should consistently translate these initiatives into estimated financial, operational, or risk-based impact to make the value more tangible at an executive level.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Justin effectively highlighted several credible cost savings and cost avoidance measures, including reduced reliance on third-party services, improved labor efficiency through equipment investments, and lifecycle extension of flooring and carpet assets. The examples were concrete and relevant to Boeing’s operating environment. Elevation to a 5 would require clearer quantification and documentation of savings over time and how these practices are sustained and replicated across sites.",

These initiatives showed a willingness to test, adopt, and scale improvements that directly enhance efficiency and service quality. Continued focus on standardizing these innovations into formal playbooks and measuring outcomes consistently would further elevate this area.",

He clearly owned the turnaround efforts and highlighted the decisive actions taken, including leadership redeployment and internal talent development. This section was a strength. Further improvement would come from outlining clearer timelines and metrics used to determine when a site is fully stabilized.",

His storytelling was clear and engaging, though occasionally dense. Continued refinement toward more concise executive-level framing and sharper quantification of impact will further elevate his presence.\r\n\r\nJustin delivered a strong 2025 performance across a complex, high-visibility portfolio. His strengths lie in execution, leadership development, and proactive value creation. The opportunity ahead is to sharpen quantification, standardize innovations, and continue elevating executive storytelling. Justin is operating at a high level and is well positioned for continued growth and increased scope."

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Peggy outlined several important initiatives focused on stabilizing a fragile account, including leadership changes, communication cadence improvements, labor coverage planning, and preparation for future contract expansion. The intent and ownership were evident, particularly around addressing operational strain and relationship health. To strengthen this section, future reviews should more clearly distinguish between initiatives delivered versus in-progress and more explicitly articulate what changed for the client as a result of each action.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Peggy demonstrated thoughtful decision-making around value creation, particularly in balancing service delivery with labor constraints and setting expectations with CBRE around periodic services and ATB work. These efforts helped preserve service quality in a constrained environment. To elevate this further, Peggy should translate these actions into clearer business impact, including directional financial framing or risk avoidance outcomes tied to client satisfaction and retention.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost savings were discussed primarily in the context of constraints rather than outcomes. While the caution around avoiding short-term labor reductions ahead of contract extension is sound, this section would benefit from clearer articulation of where costs were controlled, avoided, or shifted in a sustainable way. Even modest examples of disciplined financial stewardship would strengthen credibility here.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Peggy showed encouraging signs of continuous improvement through recalibration of audit scoring, documentation of PTO and entitlement tracking, and preparation for AI-enabled audit verification. These initiatives demonstrate forward thinking and process discipline. To move to a higher rating, future reviews should include clearer outcomes, lessons learned, and how these improvements can be standardized or scaled.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "This was a strength. Peggy was transparent and candid about challenges, including labor constraints, union dynamics, leadership gaps, and the fragility of the account pending contract extension. She demonstrated ownership without defensiveness and articulated corrective actions taken. Adding clearer timelines and success criteria for these actions would further strengthen accountability signaling.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Peggy articulated a cautious but thoughtful forward strategy centered on stabilizing service delivery, securing the contract extension, and positioning for potential expansion. The direction is appropriate given the account’s current state. To elevate this section, future articulation should include clearer sequencing, priorities, and a sharper view of how the account will be strengthened post-extension.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Peggy was honest and self-aware in discussing her personal development goals, particularly around building confidence and comfort with executive presentations. This level of candor is positive. To strengthen this section, personal goals should be more clearly defined, measurable, and tied to role expectations, such as improving executive storytelling, confidence in structured reviews, and repeatable preparation methods.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "While Peggy demonstrated deep operational knowledge and authenticity, executive presence and presentation confidence were inconsistent. Nervousness impacted clarity and structure at times. This is an area for focused development. With targeted coaching, practice, and structured preparation, Peggy can materially improve her executive communication and confidence over the next review cycle.\r\n\r\nPeggy is a thoughtful, disciplined operator managing a constrained and sensitive account with care and integrity. Her strongest strengths are transparency, relationship stewardship, and operational realism. The key development opportunity is elevating executive communication, sharpening outcome-based storytelling, and translating operational actions into clearer business impact. With focused support and practice, Peggy can strengthen her effectiveness and confidence at the Account Director level."

I thought this was better than the first run especially once you got into it. Keep working on creating a conversational tone to let you speak strongly."

            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Merck has some of the most aggressive cost savings goals I have seen initially 30%. To execute without interruption and hold our results is very impressive. Gaining trust was a key sentence that you said. It has been hard to manage Sodexo successfully. We provided the savings proposal even if we didnt have to execute the removal of 44 people. It will be a win at anything less than 30%. I would like to have seen more on the optimization proposals with some depth to service delivery impacts.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Merck rejected our innovation due to GDP gap. How can we overcome this? (see note in 2026 goals) Is there a way to get 4i GDP approved? Centralized trash had a very big impact this could be a case study shared amongst the ops team.",

While you clearly articulated the what in what we have done I felt the impact to Merck was missing. What about us is different or better than our competitors? Why does Merck continue to chose us not just because we do what they ask but the value we bring what is that? Your notes were a helpful guide but you relied heavily on them, however, when asked you were able to provide more details which I appreciated. I challenge you to know the value, the why, and command the room wit authority over your material you have done great things - brag about it :)"

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "David led and owned a highly complex site consolidation, transitioning Merck operations from Kenilworth and Madison into Rahway and effectively supporting the establishment of Rahway as the new headquarters. The increase in headcount from ~3,000 to ~6,500 without business disruption, union grievances, or work stoppages is a meaningful operational achievement. David clearly demonstrated ownership, coordination across multiple stakeholders, and disciplined execution. This was a strong section and appropriately positioned as a major 2025 accomplishment.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "David articulated several operational value adds, particularly around continuity of service, stakeholder engagement, and maintaining quality during a major transition. While the operational discipline was evident, the articulation of value leaned more toward effort than impact. This section would be strengthened by more explicitly tying value adds to outcomes Merck cares about, such as risk mitigation, employee experience, or avoided disruption during consolidation.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost savings were clearly identified and quantified, most notably the $404K reduction achieved through optimization of ABW and portering services. David did a solid job explaining how service levels and SLAs were preserved despite reduced hours, reinforcing credibility. This was one of the stronger sections of the review and demonstrated both financial discipline and operational stewardship.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "The initiatives presented were largely optimization-driven rather than innovative, but they were appropriate given the scale of the transition and the maturity of the account. David showed an understanding of how to evolve service models to match Merck’s flexible workplace strategy. To elevate this section, future reviews should highlight lessons learned, repeatable playbooks, or process improvements that can be scaled beyond Rahway.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "David acknowledged the complexity and risk inherent in the consolidation effort and demonstrated accountability for overseeing the entire project. He was transparent about the challenges and showed confidence in the controls and governance used to manage them. This section reflected solid ownership and credibility as an account leader.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "David referenced continued optimization and operational stability but did not fully articulate a forward-looking strategy beyond maintaining performance and cost discipline. A clearer 2026 narrative around growth opportunities, service evolution, or deeper strategic partnership with Merck would strengthen this section.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "While David demonstrated maturity and confidence in his role, personal development goals were not explicitly articulated.

At times, responses could be more crisply framed around business outcomes rather than operational details. Sharpening executive storytelling and proactively answering the “why it matters” will elevate his presence with senior audiences.\r\n\r\nDavid delivered a strong operational review anchored by a significant, well-executed consolidation effort and tangible cost savings. His strengths lie in execution, ownership, and operational discipline. The next step in his development is sharpening outcome-based storytelling and articulating a more forward-looking strategic narrative. Overall, this was a solid performance that reflects a dependable and capable account leader."

These efforts were necessary and appropriately prioritized given the account’s state. To strengthen this section, future articulation should more clearly frame these initiatives in terms of client impact and outcomes, not just execution, and explicitly distinguish between baseline operational requirements and discretionary leadership decision",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Learning curve acknowledged - Rade demonstrated thoughtful intent around value creation through improved visibility, transparency, and partnership with CBRE. These efforts helped stabilize operations and reduce friction across teams. However, value adds were described more qualitatively than quantitatively. To elevate this section, Rade should translate these improvements into clearer operational, financial, or risk-avoidance outcomes that matter to the client.",

While route optimization and workload balancing likely contributed to efficiency, this section would benefit from clearer ownership of savings delivered, avoided costs, or sustained efficiencies. Even directional estimates or examples of disciplined cost control would strengthen credibility here.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Rade showed a practical approach to continuous improvement by implementing management systems that improved visibility and accountability and strengthened the partnership with CBRE. While these changes were more evolutionary than innovative, they were appropriate for the role and timing. To reach a higher rating, future reviews should highlight lessons learned, measurable improvements, and how these practices can be standardized or scaled.",

He communicated challenges clearly and focused on corrective actions within his control. This section reflected maturity and credibility.

While the presentation lacked polish at times, he maintained composure and stayed focused on the substance. Continued practice around executive storytelling, sharper framing of outcomes, and more confident pacing will meaningfully elevate his presence.\r\n\r\nperformed well within the expectations of an interim Account Manager, prioritizing stability, transparency, and partnership during a period of operational need. His strengths are accountability, practicality, and steady leadership. The next level of growth will come from sharper outcome framing, clearer quantification of impact, and more confident executive communication. With continued development, Rade shows solid potential to take on expanded responsibility."

While I understand the MSA being a contributing project it does not reflect anything that the site could feel or find value in. Reduction of temp labor as an initiative is really specific to SBM it doesn't help us show value to the customer. The three overall initiatives aren't very impactful to the customer.

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "Greg highlighted the successful five-year contract renewal as the anchor achievement for 2025, which is a meaningful outcome given Abbott’s focus on cost discipline and prior years of optimization. He also referenced selective scope growth and the onboarding of a new site mid-January. While these are relevant initiatives, they were presented in a bundled manner that made it harder to clearly distinguish “projects” versus financial outcomes. This section would benefit from sharper separation and clearer framing of why each initiative mattered strategically to Abbott.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Greg called out approximately $14K in cost avoidance at Abbott Park, funded by SBM to strengthen the relationship at the headquarters location. The intent and outcome were positive, and the initiative appears to have delivered relationship value. However, the broader value narrative leaned heavily toward financial mechanics rather than client impact. Elevating this section with clearer linkage to stakeholder trust, risk reduction, or long-term renewal confidence would strengthen the message.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Greg provided helpful context around why cost savings were more limited in 2025, noting that Abbott had already realized significant savings in prior years. He demonstrated alignment with the client’s expectations and explained how right-sizing and model adjustments maintained savings within Abbott’s pricing framework. While the explanation was sound, the delivery could be more concise and outcome-focused, with clearer articulation of how SBM helped Abbott sustain savings without compromising service.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Innovation was not a central theme in the presentation, which Greg appropriately acknowledged given the account’s maturity and prior cost-cutting cycles. That said, the section would benefit from highlighting incremental improvements, governance refinements, or process changes that show continuous evolution even in a stabilized account.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Greg demonstrated awareness of the constraints on cost savings and showed alignment with Abbott’s financial posture. He took accountability for managing within those limits and avoided over-promising. This was a steady, credible section, though it could be strengthened by explicitly naming key risks and how they were mitigated during the renewal year.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "The forward-looking narrative was present but understated. Greg referenced continued alignment and stability but did not clearly outline a proactive strategy for 2026 beyond maintaining the current model. A stronger vision around relationship expansion, targeted value creation, or strategic differentiation would elevate this section.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Personal development goals were not explicitly articulated. Greg presents as steady and experienced, but future reviews would benefit from clearer self-reflection on growth areas or leadership objectives tied to the account’s next phase.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Greg was calm, credible, and clearly knowledgeable about the account. At times, content was bundled in a way that blurred sections, which made it harder for the audience to track against the rubric. Tightening structure and clearly signposting each section would materially improve executive clarity. \r\n\r\nGreg delivered a solid, credible review anchored by a successful long-term contract renewal and disciplined financial stewardship. His strength lies in stability, alignment, and managing mature accounts with constrained cost levers. The primary opportunity is sharpening structure and storytelling to clearly separate projects, value, and outcomes, and to articulate a more forward-leaning strategy for 2026. Overall, this was a dependable performance that reflects steady account leadership."

He demonstrated strong judgment in prioritizing GMP compliance, FDA inspection readiness, and SOP modernization, and clearly explained why these efforts were critical to Takeda’s risk profile and long-term operations. The narrative was outcome-driven, showed ownership end-to-end, and made it clear what changed for the client as a result of the work.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Luis delivered exceptional examples of value beyond contract scope. He translated operational improvements into tangible financial, sustainability, and risk-reduction outcomes, including meaningful cost avoidance, waste reduction, and regulatory confidence. The work demonstrated intentional decision-making, proactive partnership, and a clear understanding of how to align SBM’s efforts with Takeda’s strategic priorities.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Cost savings were clearly articulated, quantified, and tied to repeatable process improvements rather than one-time actions. Luis showed strong ownership of execution, from SOP redesign through testing, implementation, and hypercare. The savings were framed in a way that demonstrated long-term sustainability and strong financial stewardship, reinforcing SBM’s role as a trusted operational partn",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Luis demonstrated meaningful innovation within a highly regulated environment, which is notably difficult to do well. His ability to influence SOP changes after a decade, introduce reusable materials, and advance sustainability programs reflects mature leadership, credibility with the client, and continuous improvement thinking. Innovation was practical, scalable, and client-centric.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "Luis acknowledged the increased complexity and risk associated with higher compliance requirements and increased documentation volume, and clearly owned the operational response. He demonstrated accountability by explaining how risk was actively managed rather than avoided. This section would be further strengthened by briefly highlighting one or two lessons learned that could be applied to other GMP accounts.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Luis presented a clear forward-looking strategy tied to electronic logbooks, continued sustainability leadership, and deeper operational partnership. The path forward felt intentional and aligned with Takeda’s trajectory. This section could be elevated by explicitly calling out how SBM will scale or replicate these wins across other regulated accounts.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Luis demonstrated strong role maturity through the way he spoke about partnership, accountability, and long-term impact. While personal development goals were not explicitly outlined, his ownership of complex, high-risk initiatives signals readiness for increased scope. Articulating personal growth objectives would further strengthen future reviews.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "The strongest, most structured presentations across the group (so far). His visuals were clear, his narrative was disciplined, and his delivery balanced confidence with credibility. He communicated complex regulatory and operational topics in a way that was accessible, compelling, and executive-ready.\r\n\r\nLuis delivered an exceptional year-end review that exemplifies what strong account leadership looks like in a regulated, high-stakes environment. He demonstrated clear ownership, strategic thinking, and the ability to translate complex work into meaningful client outcomes. This was a best-in-class performance and a strong benchmark for GMP and enterprise accounts moving forward."

From the start, Scott owned it. He transitioned it seamlessly and have managed it exceptionally well.\r\n\r\nWhat really stood out to me is that it didn’t suck the life out of the SLT team and that says a lot. That doesn’t happen often. You consistently provided updates the good, the bad, and the ugly and regardless of the challenge, you came with a solution. You didn’t just bring problems up; you solved them.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, you’re a trusted advisor for both SBM and the client. While all ADs are empowered, in this case it genuinely showed. as said in the presentation they have been very reluctant to make a change.\r\n\r\nEverything you have done for the last 12 months has positioned you and SBM very well for the growth.

            "Key Projects & Initiatives": "I think there's an opportunity to tie more of our initiatives to our customer's goals in order to better define impact. One public example, waste reduction. Micron is targeting 95% diversion from landfill. If our sustainability initiative is to use cores of paper towels, etc. toward reuse but ultimately they still end up in the landfill, our initiative may be slightly misaligned with Micron's overall goal. Maybe we target dual roll dispensers from GP that automatically dispense a second roll towel when the first roll depletes, encouraging full utilization of that stub roll. Tork Peakserve is another potential option. I think you gave some compelling examples of initiatives (plate scraping, etc) that have real impact on the client's goals. Just want to encourage more communication around what the client's specific goals are, even searching publicly available information, and crafting our initiatives and messaging around how we can impact them.",
            "Value Adds & Cost Avoidance": "Provided strong examples of value creation with diretional financial framing. I LOVED that you called out window cleaning cost savings leading to enhanced service performance at the SJC site. We tend to forget about \"savings\" like this that don't result in YOY impact, but the fact that funds were able to be pivoted into other customer priorities with SBM is exactly the kind of cost savings we want to drive. Savings on urinal mats and other initiatives could be quanitifed, tightened. But each was a compelling example.",
            "Cost Savings Delivered": "Regarding value-added work, I'm not sure there was a quantified amount that we delivered to the client in SJC, which makes me wonder if the client understands the value of our reinvestment into that site. It's 100% OK to deliver a project at no charge or at cost, better if the client knows they're getting something for free, and best for the client to know (and be reminded of) the estimated values of of the work we've done for them. Again, thought you had strong examples here, I just wonder if we could tighten up some of the quantified impact.",
            "Innovation & Continuous Improvement": "Mentioned this on the call, but I love that you are leaning into areas where the company has limited playbook for you to go off of (construction cleaning, MAC work, event support, & more). You're helping write the playbook, and I think that's impressive and commendable.",
            "Issues, Challenges & Accountability": "We trust your assessment that the gaps in SJC were largely due to a demanding client. This may have glazed over some of the real misses down there, and opportunities for improvement. The end result is that you managed the account and led the team to right wrongs and improe our service. Just think there may have been more room for partial ownership of challenges down there, and that honestly they would have done nothing but strengthen your already strong credibility on the call.",
            "2026 Forward Strategy & Vision": "Love the tenacity on Micron Singapore. Second the feedback of others regarding intermediate steps, or the bite-size chunks you'll be taking along the way. I think others were concerned about time-bound goals, I'd encourage more thinking around what needs to happen, in sequence, for your big vision to take effect, and road-mapping that for SLT.",
            "Personal Goals & Role Maturity": "Feedback previously given regarding time-bound goals, but I think you had a strong vision for where the account can and will be in 2027 and I very much look forward to seeing and helping you achieve it.",
            "Executive Presence & Presentation Skills": "Discussion was led with confidence and authority, with a well-constructed story of achievements on the account. Your presentation style is engaging and easy to interact with."

The result: NVIDIA positioned to renew early in February (2 months ahead), avoided RFP risk, and is now going on year 9 with SBM (3rd consecutive renewal).

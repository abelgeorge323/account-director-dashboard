To elevate further, tightening the narrative around outcomes, ownership, and decision rationale will help Paul lead executive-level discussions with greater authority and clarity.

Paul is in a reasonable ramp phase and is demonstrating the right instincts around strategy, partnership, and modernization of the Google account. The primary opportunity moving into 2026 is sharpening outcome-based framing, clearly defining ownership versus partner-driven initiatives, and translating strategy into measurable results. With greater clarity on the “why” behind initiatives and more explicit articulation of impact, Paul is well positioned to strengthen his effectiveness and influence over the next year.",3

She demonstrated strong self-awareness, owned the gaps, and clearly articulated what she would do differently moving forward. This level of reflection and accountability is a strong leadership signal.",5,"Ana articulated a clear forward-looking approach centered on strengthening talent placement, repairing key stakeholder relationships, and continuing to position SBM as a proactive partner. The strategy is grounded and aligned with client priorities.

To strengthen this section, Jack should more explicitly frame what was intentionally done in 2025, why those actions mattered, and what changed for the client as a result beyond continued continuity.",3,"Jack demonstrated a strong service mindset and clear intent to deliver value beyond the contract, particularly through deep cleanings during down days, preventive maintenance support, and discretionary work performed without incremental charges. These examples reflect trust, partnership, and good judgment. To elevate further, this section would benefit from clearer structure around how value-add decisions are made and more explicit translation of these efforts into operational or risk-based impact for the client.",4,"Jack articulated meaningful cost savings and avoidance delivered in 2025, with reasonable estimates tied to deep cleanings, preventive maintenance, and efficiency improvements. The fact that the account has remained consistently green is a strong signal of financial stewardship.

The presentation relied more on conversational explanation than a structured executive narrative. Tightening the storyline around initiatives, outcomes, and forward strategy would strengthen executive presence and ensure the full impact of the work is clearly conveyed.

Jack runs a very stable, high-performing account with exceptional client trust and consistent financial results. That foundation is strong and should not be understated. The opportunity ahead is elevating how that performance is framed and articulated at an executive level—moving from “we do a great job and the client trusts us” to clearly documenting initiatives, outcomes, risks, and forward strategy.

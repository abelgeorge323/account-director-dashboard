Challenge: 'We had a lot of different new leaders coming in from either the incumbent or external hires.' Strategy: 'Transitioning to a sustaining state I would say was one of the biggest things that we focused on this year.' This involved: (1) One-on-one meetings with each site leader across entire portfolio to align on scope expectations and outcomes (started September 2025), (2) Scope alignment from frequency-based to outcome-based contract - 'Led to a lot of back and forth on what's in and out of scope... old work orders... team from incumbent was used to billing that,' (3) Shift and task alignment with Amazon 24/7 office schedules - 'They said for years they had been trying to understand Amazon shift schedule. It was our site leadership team that led those discussions,' (4) Management process enhancement - 'We took on a lot of incumbent managers, external hires, nobody with a lot of SBM stink on them... really doing deep dive training and making sure we're bringing our site managers up to SBM standard.' Result: Late December through January saw 'tremendous uptick' in ForSight quality/quantity of audits.

Solution: '(1) Utilizing teams and setting up individual region by region teams chats to ensure that we're communicating real time.

      "context": "Labor pressure: 'Amazon has been extremely tight and to save an hour here, an hour there from an efficiency standpoint helps us a lot.' Four innovations: (1) Steam cleaners for bathroom grout, (2) Portable supplies for workstation cleanings - 'Power pack that runs for about 6 hours that you can take and plug stuff into. So it's more maneuverable and efficient when it comes to cleaning. Specifically with Amazon, you have to clean the workstation during peak. Only time you can do that. Think about an AR sort 4 floors, about 500 workstations. You have their breaks. You have two or three half hour to an hour break that you can clean the workstations. So that has significantly helped upkeep throughout peak and then it's going to help outside of peak with the dark times, 5:00 to 7:00 AM, PM, we're able to get more people up there. We don't have to use cords,' (3) Stick vacuum for break rooms - 'Break rooms according to the fail criteria and according to scope of work, it has to be fully cleaned within 45 minutes post break. We were either sweeping or taking a quarter vacuum and vacuuming, whereas with the stick vacs which are great for break rooms, it created the efficiency and it really helped us across the board hit that 45 minute post break cleaning deadline,' (4) Blowers for rack cleanings - 'Previously we were not cleaning the under racks throughout the month it was two-month, three month turn around... Getting blowers, implementing blowers rather than using a dust mop underneath the racking significantly helped the efficiency. Instead of getting 3 racks done, we're getting 12 to 15 racks done a day, which was creating that monthly cadence.'

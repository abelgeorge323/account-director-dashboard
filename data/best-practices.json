The data supported reducing lab cleaning frequency from weekly to bi-weekly without compromising quality. This delivered $190K/year in savings (2.8% of total contract) plus avoided $44K in new construction labor costs. CBRE highlighted this as their 'huge success story for savings for 2025.' The methodology is highly replicable - most vendors guess at cleaning frequencies, but Justin used data to prove what's actually needed. Valarie Barnett praised this as the kind of strategic cost reduction that strengthens rather than weakens partnerships.",

What really stood out to me is that it didn’t suck the life out of the SLT team and that says a lot. That doesn’t happen often. You consistently provided updates the good, the bad, and the ugly and regardless of the challenge, you came with a solution. You didn’t just bring problems up; you solved them.

Most importantly, you’re a trusted advisor for both SBM and the client. While all ADs are empowered, in this case it genuinely showed. as said in the presentation they have been very reluctant to make a change.

One public example, waste reduction. Micron is targeting 95% diversion from landfill. If our sustainability initiative is to use cores of paper towels, etc. toward reuse but ultimately they still end up in the landfill, our initiative may be slightly misaligned with Micron's overall goal. Maybe we target dual roll dispensers from GP that automatically dispense a second roll towel when the first roll depletes, encouraging full utilization of that stub roll. Tork Peakserve is another potential option. I think you gave some compelling examples of initiatives (plate scraping, etc) that have real impact on the client's goals. Just want to encourage more communication around what the client's specific goals are, even searching publicly available information, and crafting our initiatives and messaging around how we can impact them. ",4,"Provided strong examples of value creation with diretional financial framing. I LOVED that you called out window cleaning cost savings leading to enhanced service performance at the SJC site. We tend to forget about ""savings"" like this that don't result in YOY impact, but the fact that funds were able to be pivoted into other customer priorities with SBM is exactly the kind of cost savings we want to drive. Savings on urinal mats and other initiatives could be quanitifed, tightened. But each was a compelling example.",4,"Regarding value-added work, I'm not sure there was a quantified amount that we delivered to the client in SJC, which makes me wonder if the client understands the value of our reinvestment into that site. It's 100% OK to deliver a project at no charge or at cost, better if the client knows they're getting something for free, and best for the client to know (and be reminded of) the estimated values of of the work we've done for them. Again, thought you had strong examples here, I just wonder if we could tighten up some of the quantified impact.",4,"Mentioned this on the call, but I love that you are leaning into areas where the company has limited playbook for you to go off of (construction cleaning, MAC work, event support, & more). You're helping write the playbook, and I think that's impressive and commendable.",5,"We trust your assessment that the gaps in SJC were largely due to a demanding client. This may have glazed over some of the real misses down there, and opportunities for improvement. The end result is that you managed the account and led the team to right wrongs and improe our service. Just think there may have been more room for partial ownership of challenges down there, and that honestly they would have done nothing but strengthen your already strong credibility on the call.",4,"Love the tenacity on Micron Singapore. Second the feedback of others regarding intermediate steps, or the bite-size chunks you'll be taking along the way. I think others were concerned about time-bound goals, I'd encourage more thinking around what needs to happen, in sequence, for your big vision to take effect, and road-mapping that for SLT.

Regarding scope alignment, I would have appreciated additional detail on how the misalignment originated and whether any corrective steps were taken before end user concerns surfaced and the final resolution was reached. It would also be helpful to understand how our partnership and working relationship with JLL influenced the process and outcome.

Overall, you demonstrated a solid partnership mindset and the ability to pivot effectively to support initiatives that matter to both our client and the end users.",4,"Regarding the value add, I believe there was a missed opportunity to highlight the leadership impact created by having two dedicated leaders supporting IBM. With SBM investing in the partnership through both you and Lou, it would have been helpful to understand how this has strengthened relationships with both onsite and offsite leadership teams. We know this investment has created tangible benefits, and further elaboration would have reinforced that point.

On cost avoidance and savings, you delivered a clear and effective communication of the financial impacts, successfully demonstrating our value as a strategic partner.",4,"The cost‑savings presented were impactful, though largely one‑time initiatives. Identifying more sustainable, long‑term savings may be challenging due to current contractual limitations and wage related constraints.

You noted your engagement with the HSSE partner at JLL and the review of our Good Catch program as an added benefit.

I also appreciate your openness to learning and your willingness to incorporate additional perspectives, such as bringing Melissa into the conversation to help strengthen opportunities and solutions.",4,"Focusing on a successful RFP and the upcoming Austin transition represents the most clearly defined and impactful priorities we can have at this stage. It’s encouraging to hear the proactive steps being taken to ensure success, as well as your clear understanding of the timelines involved. Incorporating potential innovations into the Austin site for future consideration also demonstrates forward thinking beyond the transition itself and highlights opportunities for added value.",4,"I appreciate the personal accountability you demonstrate in recognizing what you don’t yet know whether due to tenure or coming from outside the industry.

You clearly outlined your goals with timelines and desired outcomes, all of which will positively impact you, our customers, and the advancement of your team.",4,"I’ll tie this back to both your dialogue with Nick V. and your exchange with Valarie. Your ability to respond confidently and clearly to unrehearsed, unscripted questions demonstrates strong executive presence. With Valarie’s line of questioning, I would have liked to hear a more “bottom line up front” approach, especially since you have the knowledge and insight to address her budget questions with even greater clarity.

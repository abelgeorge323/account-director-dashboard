Strong overview, but additional quantification of outcomes would strengthen this area.",4,"Mentioned value-add activities, but lacked financial framing.

This was addressed on the call but lack of values hurts this section. There was a very short turnaround time but even estimates would have helped to contextualize the impact of the different activities. ,4,Very clear explanation of cost savings by location with cost breakdown included. ,5,Clear articulation of projects but was a little light on what the why of the project was. Would have been helpful to hear what problem the innovations were trying to solve. ,4,Between the opening section in 4I and the slide deck I felt this was covered very well. Issues were tackled head on without avoidance or deflection and clear remedies were articulated. Very good job answering questions in this section. ,5,Path forward was well done. There were clear targets/objectives and a real plan on how to achieve them. ,5,There were good goals in this section but all account focused not personal. I think some of this content could have been in the path forward and I would have liked to see at least one self-reflective goal.,3,First one -> It was Good,5

Include specific details and the cost savings drivers.,4,OK job here.  Slight mention of Autonomous and could have expanded on outcomes and results. Failed to mention all autonomous being used (i.e. window cleaning) Good but long story on pest control. More high-level descriptions needed.,3,MYO explanation good. Clearly articulated Merck reasoning. Failed to speak to what percentages and initiatives that we proposed based on the Merck ask and requirements for MYO.,3,Lacking details with closure plan.,3,Personal goal to develop management team but needs to include more detail. Need to articulate better.,3,Very hard to follow. Floated around and did not stick to topic which really impacted his messaging.,2

You are clearly knowledgeable and speak very confidently about each topic.

I felt the projects bled together slightly and could have used a little stronger differentiation during the explanation. While the detail was great on each category this slide ended up taking a lot of the presentation and could probably have been slimed down. ,5,This ties back to the key projects and how you have continued to reinvest in the team and the account.

I did appreciate the focus on what you were working on but would have liked to see more on what you specifically are going to develop from a skills and growth standpoint. ,4,You very clearly own the account and speak from a place of practical knowledge. There was some excellent conversation on some of the topics which was great to see. The timing was slightly off after the first slide and cascaded to the rest of the slides.

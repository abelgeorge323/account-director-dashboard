        <div class="criteria-box">
            <h4>What Qualifies as a Best Practice?</h4>
            <p>To be classified as a <strong>Company Best Practice</strong>, an initiative must meet ALL five criteria:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Repeatable:</strong> Can be executed consistently across different accounts/situations</li>
                <li><strong>Material Impact:</strong> Demonstrates measurable financial, operational, or strategic value</li>
                <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Can be transferred and applied to other accounts or verticals</li>
                <li><strong>Intentionally Designed:</strong> Not accidental; was planned and executed with purpose</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership-Reinforced:</strong> Explicitly praised or endorsed by executive leadership</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Top Practices Identified for Enterprise Scaling</h3>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">1. Quantifying Value-Adds Methodology</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Benjamin Ehrenberg</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Repeatable framework for tracking gratuitous services with dollar figures (frequent setups, escort avoidance, out-of-scope work)</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> At Lockheed Martin, Ben needed to demonstrate value beyond base contract scope. The challenge: clients see routine service execution as 'just doing your job,' not as added value. Ben created a systematic framework to track and quantify all gratuitous services with actual dollar figures - things like frequent last-minute setups, escort avoidance, and out-of-scope work that other vendors would charge for. This transforms client perception from 'meeting expectations' to 'delivering measurable partnership value.' Leadership explicitly challenged Ben to implement this in 2026 as it provides powerful retention ammunition during renewals by showing documented cost avoidance.</p>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">2. Gap Analysis as Strategic Opportunity Framework</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Mark Schlerf</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Turn CBRE Lam Research gap analysis (potential minefield showing contract vs. actual performance) into strategic investment opportunities by showing 'what is different by location and what the opportunities are' for client to fund improvements</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> When CBRE asked Mark to conduct a gap analysis at Lam Research comparing contract language to actual performance across sites, it could have been a landmine - exposing service deficiencies and creating ammunition for price reduction or termination. Instead, Mark strategically reframed it as an opportunity identification exercise. He showed 'what is different by location' and presented the gaps as investment opportunities for the client to fund scope improvements. This turned a potential liability into a value conversation, positioning SBM as a strategic partner rather than a vendor under scrutiny. Nick Viskovich praised this approach as a masterclass in strategic thinking.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">3. JLL Quarterly Operations Reviews Cadence</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Mark Schlerf</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Structured quarterly review process with IFM partners to align on performance, innovation, and growth</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Mark established a disciplined quarterly review cadence with JLL as the IFM partner across his portfolio. These aren't reactive check-ins but proactive strategic sessions covering performance metrics, innovation roadmaps, and growth opportunities. This governance model has strengthened the IFM relationship to the point where renewals happen off-market without competitive bidding. Nick Viskovich noted this as a replicable best practice that creates predictability and reduces client anxiety while positioning SBM as an indispensable strategic partner rather than a transactional vendor.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">4. Luna's Standard Cadence for Transitions</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Grant Frazier</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Standardized weekly client update process for transitions; drove all standard processes forward systematically</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> When Meta awarded SBM two massive new campuses (Fremont and Sunnyvale totaling $800K in new revenue), Grant's operations manager Luna created a systematic weekly client update framework specifically for transitions. The process included standardized checkpoints: staffing status, quality metrics, client feedback loops, issue resolution, and next week's priorities. This disciplined cadence stabilized Fremont in just 1.5 months and Sunnyvale in 3 months - remarkably fast for sites of this scale. Grant openly credited Luna: 'I wouldn't have done that without Luna's ability to make those standards.' Leadership praised this as a replicable playbook for all future transitions to reduce client anxiety and accelerate revenue stabilization.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">5. Sub-Tenant Day Porter Revenue Model</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Grant Frazier</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Strategic placement of day porters for sub-tenants in property management buildings; positions SBM as exclusive provider</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> In property management buildings (like Meta's San Francisco HQ at SF181), Grant identified untapped revenue: sub-tenants (Klavio, Mercor) wanted dedicated day porter services but had no direct facilities relationship. Traditional vendors only serve the building owner. Grant positioned SBM as the exclusive provider to ALL building occupants, adding 3.5 FTE day porters serving multiple sub-tenants for $34K in incremental revenue. This micro-innovation model is portable to any multi-tenant building nationally and demonstrates SBM's strategic thinking beyond traditional janitorial scope. Nick Viskovich praised this as differentiated business development thinking.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">6. 12-Month Renewal Planning Strategy</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Stuart Kelloff</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Plan NVIDIA renewal throughout all of 2025 for April 2026 expiration (not just last 3-4 months); consistent implementation of reinvestment practices throughout the year</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Most Account Directors plan renewals 3-4 months before expiration, leading to last-minute scrambles and client skepticism. Stuart took a radically different approach for NVIDIA's April 2026 renewal: he planned throughout ALL of 2025, implementing consistent reinvestment practices as an operating rhythm rather than a 'renewal push.' This means tiered wage increases, equipment upgrades, and governance improvements happened steadily all year. The result: NVIDIA positioned to renew early in February (2 months ahead), avoided RFP risk, and is now going on year 9 with SBM (3rd consecutive renewal). Leadership gave this approach 5/5 scores and cited it as a best practice for de-risking renewals and building genuine partnerships.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">7. Tiered Wage Rate Structure / Frontline Reinvestment</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Stuart Kelloff</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ground-up wage structure from starting to experienced employees; reinvest margin into team vs client cost reduction</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> For NVIDIA's renewal, Stuart worked with the client to create a tiered wage rate structure built from the ground up - differentiating starting employees from experienced staff. Instead of taking margin to the bottom line or reducing client costs, Stuart reinvested the savings back into the frontline team through wage increases and career progression pathways. NVIDIA saw this as partnership behavior rather than profit extraction. The client explicitly wanted this reinvestment approach as part of the renewal strategy. Nick Viskovich gave this 5/5 for value-add, noting it improves retention, reduces training costs, and positions SBM as an employer of choice.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">8. Weekly Scorecard Reviews with Client</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Stuart Kelloff</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Structured weekly review cadence with NVIDIA/CBRE on performance metrics, safety, quality</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Stuart established a structured weekly (not monthly, not quarterly) scorecard review with NVIDIA and CBRE covering performance metrics, safety incidents, quality scores, and upcoming initiatives. This creates a predictable rhythm where issues surface early and get resolved before they escalate. It also demonstrates transparency and partnership commitment that monthly reviews can't match. Leadership noted this as a governance best practice that reduces client complaints by 60%+, strengthens partnership perception, and serves as an early warning system. The discipline of weekly reviews forces operational excellence and eliminates the 'hoping problems go away' trap.</p>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">9. Non-Routine to ATB Budget Conversion</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Jacqueline Maravilla</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Identified non-routine work orders consuming SOW headcount; met with customer and got approval to pull non-routine onto above-the-base</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> At Alonza, Jacqueline's budget was persistently red despite hitting service levels. Deep analysis revealed non-routine work orders (urgent cleanings, emergency responses, GMP area shutdowns) were consuming SOW headcount budget but weren't being billed separately - classic scope creep. She met directly with the Alonza customer and proposed moving all non-routine work to above-the-base billing. The client agreed, generating $6K/month in sustained additional revenue while freeing up SOW headcount for actual routine work. This systematic approach to scope management turned the account from red to green and protected margins without sacrificing service quality. Nick Viskovich and Dan Hartman praised this as a replicable methodology for identifying hidden revenue.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">10. Holistic Account Strategy (Unifying Silos)</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Paul Rhodes</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Unite siloed regional operations (Bay Area vs Americas) into one holistic view; initiatives flow between regions; Seattle POCs had 'no idea' about Bay Area innovations</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Google's operations are siloed by region - Bay Area and Americas operate independently with separate QBRs and strategies. Paul discovered Seattle POCs had 'no idea' about innovations happening in the Bay Area, and vice versa. JLL doesn't communicate internally across regions, so Paul is intentionally positioning himself as the connector, creating one unified Google view. This means initiatives can flow between regions, decision-making becomes more informed, and there are fewer surprises. Paul's goal for 2026-2027 is to unite these silos completely, creating enterprise visibility and alignment that JLL can't provide. Leadership acknowledged this strategic gap and praised Paul for identifying the opportunity.</p>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">11. Leadership Addition Without Client Cost</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Kimberly Wittekind</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Added Andrew Daria as project administrator (functions as account manager) by reallocating budget; no additional cost to client</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> GE Healthcare was growing rapidly and Kimberly couldn't be in multiple places at once, but the unique scope (cleaning medical equipment, not buildings) requires specialized training and sign-offs. Rather than asking GE for budget approval (which could take months), she reallocated existing budget to add Andrew Daria as a project administrator who functions as an account manager. Andrew built trust with client POC Kellyanne, supported the difficult New Orleans transition, and provides $120K/year in value to GE at zero additional cost. This creative constraint management impressed Nick Viskovich and Val as a model for scaling leadership without client pushback.</p>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">12. Tiered Cost Initiatives (Platinum/Gold/Silver)</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Ana Sabater</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Delivered detailed cost optimization proposal to CBRE with tiered service models (Platinum, Gold, Silver) showing savings options</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> At LinkedIn HQ, Ana delivered a detailed cost optimization proposal with tiered service levels (Platinum, Gold, Silver) showing exactly what CBRE could achieve at different price points and service frequencies. Currently at Platinum, the client can see what Gold or Silver would look like and make informed trade-offs. This pricing flexibility model is highly portable - it shows partnership thinking rather than 'take it or leave it' pricing, positions SBM as a strategic advisor, and gives the client control over their budget. Nick and Val praised this as strategic thinking that strengthens renewal positioning and differentiates SBM from vendors who only present one price point.</p>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">13. J&J Error Tracker (Log Book Quality Tool)</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Isaac Calderon</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Quality team implemented tracker for log book compliance; targeted corrective actions for misses</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> At Johnson & Johnson, log book compliance was a persistent client challenge - missed entries became audit targets. Isaac's quality team implemented a systematic error tracker specifically for log book compliance, enabling targeted corrective actions for any misses. Result: log books are no longer a challenge or target for J&J audits, and the quality improvement has been sustained over time. Marvin Owens praised this innovation as a simple but effective quality management tool that's highly replicable across any account with documentation compliance requirements. The key: don't just fix errors, track patterns and prevent recurrence.</p>

        <div class="best-practice">
            <div class="best-practice-title">14. Cambion Transition Playbook (6-Step Framework)</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Isaac Calderon</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> 6-step transition framework: 1) Leadership alignment, 2) Staff retention strategy, 3) Training SOP documentation, 4) Client communication cadence, 5) Quick wins identification, 6) 90-day performance baseline</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Isaac developed a documented 6-step transition framework for the Cambion account: 1) Leadership alignment (get everyone on same page), 2) Staff retention strategy (identify and keep key talent), 3) Training SOP documentation (don't rely on tribal knowledge), 4) Client communication cadence (weekly updates, not ad hoc), 5) Quick wins identification (show value fast), 6) 90-day performance baseline (measure progress). This systematic playbook delivered a smooth transition with strong client confidence and retained key staff. Marvin Owens noted the strong execution. The framework is highly replicable - it eliminates transition guesswork and ensures consistent handoff quality regardless of who's executing.</p>

            <div class="best-practice-title">15. Subcontractor Portfolio Optimization</div>
            <div class="best-practice-ad">Account Director: Patrick Murtha</div>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Systematic review of Cardinal Health subcontracted sites driving $5k/month red; pricing exercises with multiple contractors; negotiated 5% savings with current providers; switched Tolson AZ provider for 47% savings ($3,400 to $1,810)</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Patrick's Cardinal Health portfolio was $5K/month red, driven by subcontracted sites where costs exceeded revenue. Rather than accept the loss, he conducted a systematic review: pricing exercises with multiple contractors, negotiations with current providers (achieved 5% savings), and competitive switches where justified (Tolson AZ: 47% savings, dropping from $3,400 to $1,810/month). This systematic approach moved the entire Cardinal portfolio from red to green. Zach Shock praised the methodology as highly replicable for any AD managing subcontracted sites. The key: don't accept subcontractor pricing as fixed - continuously optimize like you would with direct labor.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> On-site visit to develop routes for AM/PM shifts; created task checklists; established bi-weekly meetings with CBRE and POC; developed action plan (area mgmt on-site for events, phone calls vs email, increased communication)</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> IQVIA Marietta was failing - low CSAT scores, high turnover, no defined routes, staff didn't know the scope. Patrick went on-site and built the operational foundation from scratch: developed routes for AM/PM shifts, created task checklists, established bi-weekly meetings with CBRE and POC, and created an action plan (area management on-site for major events, phone calls instead of emails for urgent issues, increased communication cadence). POC feedback after reset: 'No issues, things are great.' Strong relationship with new area manager sustained the improvement. Valarie Barnett acknowledged Patrick's transparency; Zach Shock praised execution. Highly replicable turnaround playbook.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Failed CSAT recovery: identified misalignment between Cardinal and JLL (new business unit, increased headcount); meeting with JLL corporate/regional; site walk with both POCs; updated scope; wage pass-through ($2/hr, 5th to 26th percentile); $7,034/month revenue increase</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Cardinal Greenwood failed a CSAT. During recovery, Patrick discovered a misalignment: Cardinal had opened a new business unit and increased headcount, but JLL didn't know about it. There was confusion between JLL and Cardinal about who owned what. Patrick organized a meeting with JLL corporate/regional leadership and both POCs, conducted a site walk, and identified the scope gaps. Solution: updated scope, secured a $2/hr wage pass-through (moving staff from 5th to 26th percentile for the market), and generated $7,034/month in additional revenue. This closed the gap between JLL and Cardinal while positioning SBM as the problem-solver who brings parties together. Zach Shock gave 5/5 for transparency and execution.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> At 3M Detroit, Aaron achieved the holy grail: 1 turnover in all of 2025 (0 after January), 399 days recordable-free, 4.5 internal audit score, zero failed audits, and the site runs with minimal leadership intervention - 'low touch, high reliability.' This is a lean, right-sized staffing model that's perfectly calibrated to the scope. The site is so stable that Aaron wants to use it as his governance benchmark for other accounts. Nick Viskovich praised this as a model site. The key: right-sizing isn't about cutting costs, it's about finding the exact staffing level that delivers consistent quality with minimal noise.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Aaron identified a data transparency problem: Ball portfolio showed only 14 complaints in 7 months, which didn't match client perception. Root cause: area managers weren't logging all feedback. Solution: Aaron now conducts bi-weekly scorecard reviews directly with Regional Facility Managers (RFMs), not just area managers, capturing feedback in real-time instead of waiting for local leaders to input it. Valarie Barnett's reaction: 'Almost like a reset... different level of transparency... really helpful for CBRE.'

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> At Mars, the client was fixated on headcount ('You need X people per shift'). Aaron strategically pivoted to outcomes by showcasing model sites (Lebanon TN, Cleveland TN, Leipzig OH) that achieve excellent results without headcount increases. He embedded local SBM supervisors directly with Mars sanitation leads (not just relying on CBRE as middleman) to align on outcomes, not positions. This reframes success from 'position-driven' (how many people) to 'outcome-driven' (are the spaces clean?).

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Brian manages Merck across three IFM partners (CBRE, Sodexo, Direct) with dedicated SBM resources on each. Rather than siloing expertise, he created a cross-portfolio leverage model where specialists can be pulled from one account to support another. For example, Justin from the CBRE account serves as the pest control expert for Direct sites. The scale of the portfolio supports complex problem-solving without additional client cost - 'We've got the whole team' available. Marvin Owens noted this strategic advantage as a best practice for large multi-partner accounts where SBM can provide continuity and expertise that IFMs can't match individually.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Marvin Owens handed off the Merck Workplace Experience Community of Practice leadership to Brian, positioning SBM (not CBRE or Sodexo) as the thought leader. Brian presented final survey results directly to Merck executive leadership and collaborated with other IFMs on contractual protections like scoring methodology. This forced collaboration across IFMs (where SBM leads, not follows) and increased executive-level visibility for SBM. The strategic value: when Merck thinks 'workplace experience,' they think SBM first, not the larger IFM partners. This is partnership positioning at its best.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Merck is facing a patent cliff requiring $3B in savings across all services. For the Multi-Year Optimization (MYO) custodial SLA redesign, Merck leadership (Michael Gardner, Pierre Leo) is already positioning SBM to lead - not CBRE, not Sodexo. Brian is applying an education sector 4-level service model to create tiered custodial standards. The strategic win: 'If we're looking at optimizing custodial, it's SBM.' This positions SBM as the optimization thought leader across all IFMs in a $3B initiative, creating massive visibility and influence on future scope decisions.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Justin conducted a comprehensive time study across 60 buildings covering 154 labs at Merck, measuring not just cleaning times but also travel times between buildings. The data supported reducing lab cleaning frequency from weekly to bi-weekly without compromising quality. This delivered $190K/year in savings (2.8% of total contract) plus avoided $44K in new construction labor costs. CBRE highlighted this as their 'huge success story for savings for 2025.' The methodology is highly replicable - most vendors guess at cleaning frequencies, but Justin used data to prove what's actually needed. Valarie Barnett praised this as the kind of strategic cost reduction that strengthens rather than weakens partnerships.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Justin installed Colo dispensers at Merck non-production sites and set aggressive progressive waste reduction goals: 13% → 10% → 8% → 5%. Through monthly meetings with the Colo team reviewing dashboard data, he reduced consumable waste from 33% to under 5% - a massive sustainability win. CBRE funded the $100K+ equipment investment. Valarie Barnett told Justin: 'Extra credit in 2026 if you put together a white paper on this' - comparing it to John Mann's famous white paper success. This is a replicable model for any account with sustainability goals and demonstrates how data-driven programs create client investment rather than cost reduction.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Zero observations/findings across ALL SBM managed services (janitorial, pest control, uniforms, waste) in all internal and external agency audits; continuous audit readiness vs. cramming</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> In pharmaceutical/GMP environments, most vendors 'prepare for audits' with last-minute scrambles. Justin created an 'always audit-ready' culture at Merck where sites are inspected weekly as if an audit is tomorrow. Result: Zero observations/findings across ALL SBM-managed services (janitorial, pest control, uniforms, waste) in both 2024 AND 2025 across all internal and external agency audits. Merck and CBRE effusively praised this partnership standard. This sets the industry benchmark for pharmaceutical compliance and is scalable to all GMP/regulated environments.

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> When Huntsville was failing (poor CSATs, failed audits), Angel - the site manager from Chicago - volunteered to move to Alabama for a turnaround assignment. He 'knew exactly what he was walking into' but went anyway. Result: complete transformation from failing to perfect CSAT scores. Before leaving Huntsville, Angel proactively identified and trained his Chicago successor Robert Brimmer (a 30-year veteran Chicago lead), documented all processes, and conducted shadow training over 60 days. JLL's feedback: 'They no longer have any janitorial concerns.' Leadership praised Angel's commitment and succession planning discipline.

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Kaivax (all-in-one restroom cleaner: power washer, chemical spray, toilet brush, shop vac, floor scrub in one); Viper riding scrubbers; Tenant ride-on vacuums; Whittaker carpet spotters (crystallization, no extraction/blowers needed)</p>
            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Justin invested strategically in equipment that cuts cleaning times in half: Kaivax all-in-one restroom cleaners, Viper riding scrubbers, Tenant ride-on vacuums, and Whittaker carpet spotters (crystallization method, no extraction/blowers needed). This created capacity for additional routes at no extra labor cost - like adding an OKC daytime recycle tech for free. Window cleaning in-house now saves Boeing ~$6K per clean. Extended carpet life reduces replacement costs. James Peate highlighted this when asked to quantify value. The key: invest in tools that create time, then redeploy that time to add value rather than cutting costs. Highly replicable across all accounts.</p>

            <p><strong>Context:</strong> Justin implemented a disciplined ForSight compliance tracking system with weekly coaching sessions for site teams to drive adoption and data quality. Result: 1,875 audits completed in 2025 with a 4.5 average score, 99% on-time response, 99% on-time closure, 100% satisfaction, and 100% invoice accuracy. Valarie Barnett said 'I'm comfortable with your ForSight skills' - high praise indicating Justin can now train others. James Peate praised the diligence. This systematic approach to technology adoption (training + accountability + coaching) is replicable across all ADs struggling with ForSight usage. The key: make it a discipline, not just a tool.</p>

            <div class="highlight-context">At Johnson & Johnson, log book compliance was a persistent client challenge - missed entries became audit targets. Isaac's quality team implemented a systematic error tracker specifically for log book compliance, enabling targeted corrective actions for any misses. Result: log books are no longer a challenge or target for J&J audits, and the quality improvement has been sustained over time. Marvin Owens praised this innovation as a simple but effective quality management tool that's highly replicable across any account with documentation compliance requirements. The key: don't just fix errors, track patterns and prevent recurrence.</div>

            <div class="highlight-context">Isaac developed a documented 6-step transition framework for the Cambion account: 1) Leadership alignment (get everyone on same page), 2) Staff retention strategy (identify and keep key talent), 3) Training SOP documentation (don't rely on tribal knowledge), 4) Client communication cadence (weekly updates, not ad hoc), 5) Quick wins identification (show value fast), 6) 90-day performance baseline (measure progress). This systematic playbook delivered a smooth transition with strong client confidence and retained key staff. Marvin Owens noted the strong execution. The framework is highly replicable - it eliminates transition guesswork and ensures consistent handoff quality regardless of who's executing.</div>

            <div class="highlight-context">At Alonza, Jacqueline's budget was persistently red despite hitting service levels. Deep analysis revealed non-routine work orders (urgent cleanings, emergency responses, GMP area shutdowns) were consuming SOW headcount budget but weren't being billed separately - classic scope creep. She met directly with the Alonza customer and proposed moving all non-routine work to above-the-base billing. The client agreed, generating $6K/month in sustained additional revenue while freeing up SOW headcount for actual routine work. This systematic approach to scope management turned the account from red to green and protected margins without sacrificing service quality. Nick Viskovich and Dan Hartman praised this as a replicable methodology for identifying hidden revenue.</div>

            <div class="highlight-context">When Huntsville was failing (poor CSATs, failed audits), Angel - the site manager from Chicago - volunteered to move to Alabama for a turnaround assignment. He 'knew exactly what he was walking into' but went anyway. Result: complete transformation from failing to perfect CSAT scores. Before leaving Huntsville, Angel proactively identified and trained his Chicago successor Robert Brimmer (a 30-year veteran Chicago lead), documented all processes, and conducted shadow training over 60 days. JLL's feedback: 'They no longer have any janitorial concerns.' Leadership praised Angel's commitment and succession planning discipline. This enables strategic talent deployment while reducing knowledge loss risk.</div>

            <div class="highlight-context">Justin invested strategically in equipment that cuts cleaning times in half: Kaivax all-in-one restroom cleaners, Viper riding scrubbers, Tenant ride-on vacuums, and Whittaker carpet spotters (crystallization method, no extraction/blowers needed). This created capacity for additional routes at no extra labor cost - like adding an OKC daytime recycle tech for free. Window cleaning in-house now saves Boeing ~$6K per clean. Extended carpet life reduces replacement costs. James Peate highlighted this when asked to quantify value. The key: invest in tools that create time, then redeploy that time to add value rather than cutting costs. Highly replicable across all accounts.</div>

Result: 1,875 audits completed in 2025 with a 4.5 average score, 99% on-time response, 99% on-time closure, 100% satisfaction, and 100% invoice accuracy. Valarie Barnett said 'I'm comfortable with your ForSight skills' - high praise indicating Justin can now train others. James Peate praised the diligence.

            <div class="highlight-context">Justin conducted a comprehensive time study across 60 buildings covering 154 labs at Merck, measuring not just cleaning times but also travel times between buildings. The data supported reducing lab cleaning frequency from weekly to bi-weekly without compromising quality. This delivered $190K/year in savings (2.8% of total contract) plus avoided $44K in new construction labor costs. CBRE highlighted this as their 'huge success story for savings for 2025.' The methodology is highly replicable - most vendors guess at cleaning frequencies, but Justin used data to prove what's actually needed. Valarie Barnett praised this as the kind of strategic cost reduction that strengthens rather than weakens partnerships.</div>

Through monthly meetings with the Colo team reviewing dashboard data, he reduced consumable waste from 33% to under 5% - a massive sustainability win. CBRE funded the $100K+ equipment investment. Valarie Barnett told Justin: 'Extra credit in 2026 if you put together a white paper on this' - comparing it to John Mann's famous white paper success. This is a replicable model for any account with sustainability goals and demonstrates how data-driven programs create client investment rather than cost reduction.</div>

Justin created an 'always audit-ready' culture at Merck where sites are inspected weekly as if an audit is tomorrow. Result: Zero observations/findings across ALL SBM-managed services (janitorial, pest control, uniforms, waste) in both 2024 AND 2025 across all internal and external agency audits. Merck and CBRE effusively praised this partnership standard. This sets the industry benchmark for pharmaceutical compliance and is scalable to all GMP/regulated environments. It also reduces liability risk and builds unshakeable client confidence in SBM's operational discipline.</div>

            <div class="highlight-context">GE Healthcare was growing rapidly and Kimberly couldn't be in multiple places at once, but the unique scope (cleaning medical equipment, not buildings) requires specialized training and sign-offs. Rather than asking GE for budget approval (which could take months), she reallocated existing budget to add Andrew Daria as a project administrator who functions as an account manager. Andrew built trust with client POC Kellyanne, supported the difficult New Orleans transition, and provides $120K/year in value to GE at zero additional cost. This creative constraint management impressed Nick Viskovich and Val as a model for scaling leadership without client pushback.</div>

            <div class="highlight-context">When CBRE asked Mark to conduct a gap analysis at Lam Research comparing contract language to actual performance across sites, it could have been a landmine - exposing service deficiencies and creating ammunition for price reduction or termination. Instead, Mark strategically reframed it as an opportunity identification exercise. He showed 'what is different by location' and presented the gaps as investment opportunities for the client to fund scope improvements. This turned a potential liability into a value conversation, positioning SBM as a strategic partner rather than a vendor under scrutiny. Nick Viskovich praised this approach as a masterclass in strategic thinking.</div>

Rather than accept the loss, he conducted a systematic review: pricing exercises with multiple contractors, negotiations with current providers (achieved 5% savings), and competitive switches where justified (Tolson AZ: 47% savings, dropping from $3,400 to $1,810/month). This systematic approach moved the entire Cardinal portfolio from red to green. Zach Shock praised the methodology as highly replicable for any AD managing subcontracted sites.

Patrick went on-site and built the operational foundation from scratch: developed routes for AM/PM shifts, created task checklists, established bi-weekly meetings with CBRE and POC, and created an action plan (area management on-site for major events, phone calls instead of emails for urgent issues, increased communication cadence). POC feedback after reset: 'No issues, things are great.' Strong relationship with new area manager sustained the improvement.

There was confusion between JLL and Cardinal about who owned what. Patrick organized a meeting with JLL corporate/regional leadership and both POCs, conducted a site walk, and identified the scope gaps. Solution: updated scope, secured a $2/hr wage pass-through (moving staff from 5th to 26th percentile for the market), and generated $7,034/month in additional revenue. This closed the gap between JLL and Cardinal while positioning SBM as the problem-solver who brings parties together. Zach Shock gave 5/5 for transparency and execution.</div>

Paul discovered Seattle POCs had 'no idea' about innovations happening in the Bay Area, and vice versa. JLL doesn't communicate internally across regions, so Paul is intentionally positioning himself as the connector, creating one unified Google view. This means initiatives can flow between regions, decision-making becomes more informed, and there are fewer surprises.

            <div class="highlight-context">Most Account Directors plan renewals 3-4 months before expiration, leading to last-minute scrambles and client skepticism. Stuart took a radically different approach for NVIDIA's April 2026 renewal: he planned throughout ALL of 2025, implementing consistent reinvestment practices as an operating rhythm rather than a 'renewal push.' This means tiered wage increases, equipment upgrades, and governance improvements happened steadily all year. The result: NVIDIA positioned to renew early in February (2 months ahead), avoided RFP risk, and is now going on year 9 with SBM (3rd consecutive renewal). Leadership gave this approach 5/5 scores and cited it as a best practice for de-risking renewals and building genuine partnerships.</div>

Instead of taking margin to the bottom line or reducing client costs, Stuart reinvested the savings back into the frontline team through wage increases and career progression pathways. NVIDIA saw this as partnership behavior rather than profit extraction. The client explicitly wanted this reinvestment approach as part of the renewal strategy. Nick Viskovich gave this 5/5 for value-add, noting it improves retention, reduces training costs, and positions SBM as an employer of choice.</div>

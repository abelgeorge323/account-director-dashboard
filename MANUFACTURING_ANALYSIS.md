## What Was Wrong Before

**Previous calculation showed: $8.54M**
**Actual total: $14.42M**
**Difference: $5.88M (69% higher!)**

**Main Issues:**
1. Jeremy Johnson only showed Altera ($107K) instead of Intel + Altera ($3.50M)
2. Kyle Wallace was undercounted
3. Siddarth Shah was undercounted
4. Summary aggregation was incorrect for ADs with multiple accounts
